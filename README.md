**Disclaimer:** This repository was made for the intention of teaching CSC 131 Students at Sacramento State. If you wish to adapt this for your own class then please fork the template branch. Any changes to the main branch are done in a real class environment and are not ideal for a lab in your own school site. Have fun hacking!

# Learning Environment and Global Variables

## Docker Git Container

This lab is meant to be performed in a docker container. Although the lab can be done on your host machine it is better to practice and perform new unfamiliar tasks in an isolated environment. Any change, error, or mistake can be saved and reversed in a docker container, and choosing to perform this lab on your host machine is a risk you have to factor.

## Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

Git is a software that you will have to run on your system eventually. Git can be dowloaded and installed from wed at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

Since Git is mainly a command-line tool it has many derivatives to perform actions you would otherwise type in a terminal. One such derivative comes from GitHub called GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop streamlines all the commands and actions you would perform in a terminal with a nice and modern GUI. In addition to the streamlined Git workflow, GitHub Desktop offers extra features that promote the GitHub workflow. To install GitHub Desktop visit [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
